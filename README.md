# Vim no color collections

A list of Vim colorschemes with barely any colors. Go ahead, compare and
**contrast**.

### [andreasvc/vim-256noir](https://github.com/andreasvc/vim-256noir)

> A dark 256-color color scheme for vim.
>
> Have you ever wondered why most syntax highlighting of source code is about as
> subtle and pretty as a candy shop explosion? A technical reason is the
> historical constraints imposed by 16 color terminals, but fortunately this
> limitation is easy to overcome.

>   **i**talic, and **N**ONE for syntax-related highlight groups
> - should work the same on _light_ and _dark_ background without human
>   intervention

### [pbrisbin/vim-colors-off](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off)

> For a number of weeks, I ran vim with `syntax off`. It was quite nice, with
> only two annoyances:
>
> - Bright white on jet black was a bit off-putting.
> - There were cases when I did miss the lack of color, vimdiff for example.
>
> Therefore, I aimed to find or create a colorscheme to solve these two issues.
>
> The result is very much based on the [pencil][] colorscheme, which is
> surprising because it's a very colorful colorscheme, but:
>
> - It uses a very sane approach to defining and setting colors
> - It has nice background and foreground colors
> - In the areas where I do want color, I like how it colors things
