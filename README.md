# Vim no color collections

A list of Vim color themes with barely any colors.

### [pgdouyon/vim-yin-yang](https://github.com/pgdouyon/vim-yin-yang)

> Yin-Yang is a black and white color scheme for Vim and is heavily inspired by
> [preto][] and [base16-grayscale][].
>
> I liked preto's subtle use of colors in a black/white colorscheme but found
> the contrast too high for my liking, so I created Yin-Yang as a low contrast
> version of preto.

### [ewilazarus/preto](https://github.com/ewilazarus/preto)

> A minimal dark color scheme for VIM, inspired by badwolf and 256_noir.

### [chriskempson/base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim)

> See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more
> information.

- [Dark](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/master/colors/base16-grayscale-dark.vim)
- [Light](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/master/colors/base16-grayscale-light.vim)

### [andreasvc/vim-256noir](https://github.com/andreasvc/vim-256noir)

> A dark 256-color color scheme for vim.
>
> Have you ever wondered why most syntax highlighting of source code is about as
> subtle and pretty as a candy shop explosion? A technical reason is the
> historical constraints imposed by 16 color terminals, but fortunately this
> limitation is easy to overcome.

### [davidosomething/vim-colors-meh](https://github.com/davidosomething/vim-colors-meh)

> > A 256-color / 24-bit Vim color scheme, with preference for contrast over
> > hues.
>
> It works for me, just publishing it in case someone has similar taste and
> wants to use it.

### [pbrisbin/vim-colors-off](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off)

> For a number of weeks, I ran vim with `syntax off`. It was quite nice, with
> only two annoyances:
>
> - Bright white on jet black was a bit off-putting.
> - There were cases when I did miss the lack of color, vimdiff for example.
>
> Therefore, I aimed to find or create a colorscheme to solve these two issues.
>
> The result is very much based on the [pencil][] colorscheme, which is
> surprising because it's a very colorful colorscheme, but:
>
> - It uses a very sane approach to defining and setting colors
> - It has nice background and foreground colors
> - In the areas where I do want color, I like how it colors things

### [Jorengarenar/vim-colors-B_W](https://github.com/Jorengarenar/vim-colors-B_W)

> Simple dark Vim colorscheme focused on black and white with occasional color
> accents when needed.

### [owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount](https://github.com/owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount)

> A minimal colorscheme for Vim that only puts emphasis on the paramount.

### [rj-white/vim-colors-paramountblue](https://github.com/rj-white/vim-colors-paramountblue)

> A minimal colorscheme for Vim that only puts emphasis on the paramount.
>
> Forked from [paramount][], which is based on [pencil][] and [off][].

### [reedes/vim-colors-pencil](https://github.com/reedes/vim-colors-pencil)

> A light (and dark) color scheme for Vim inspired by iA Writer

### [huyvohcmc/atlas.vim](https://github.com/huyvohcmc/atlas.vim)

> Probably the purest black and white vim colorscheme you can find on the
> internet.

### [Lokaltog/vim-monotone](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-monotone)

> Another monochrome vim colorscheme. Inspired by various
> [other](https://github.com/ewilazarus/preto) >
> [monochrome](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off) >
> [colorschemes](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome).
>
> Monotone is a middle ground between a regular colorscheme and
> [no syntax highlighting at all](https://www.kyleisom.net/blog/2012/10/17/syntax-off/).
> The colorscheme differentiates comments, strings and keywords with different
> weights and shades of gray. It emphasizes errors, warnings and search
> highlighting as shown in the screenshots below.

### [fxn/vim-monochrome](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome)

> vim-monochrome works in GUI/true-color terminals, as well as 256-color
> terminals.
